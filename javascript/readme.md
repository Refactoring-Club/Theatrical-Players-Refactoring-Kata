## TODO

1. have a conversation or produce a comedy or tragedy about inheritance and why it might make someone cringe
1. finish getting rid of the genre specific volume credit and cost calculators
1. move all of the configurationing into classes
1. rename things to be more beautiful
1. object orient things more (extract a class perhaps)
1. if we're finally happy with the refactor, add more genres! (after adding a cool test)
1. extract a function to format currency
